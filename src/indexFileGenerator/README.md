# index file generator

***
## Structure

- Two layers:

    - outer layer (one file on disk):
    ```
            hash(word_i)    FilePointer
               0            filePtr0
               1            filePtr1
               2            filePtr2
    ```
    where FilePointer is ( file name, offset, numOfDupKey ), so each FilePointer is "pointing" to a page of the secondary layer:

    - secondary layer (multiple files on disk):

        - each file is essentially a "page", which consist the **binary** form of:   
        ```        
                (hashvalue, docList, prevPage, nextPage)
        ```

## Classes

- WordFPtrPair

 Â it is in the form of:
```
        hash(word0) | FilePointer
```
- OuterLayer

  - metadata (first line in the file):
    - the file name for SecondaryLayer:

      directly output in string on the first line for now

- PageOfIndex

- SecondaryLayer

- IndexFileObj (the only public one)

***
## Dependencies

- It borrows FilePointer from file.h, ...

## some useful codes

int tempVal = stoi(tempraryStr.substr(0, 8), nullptr, 2);
