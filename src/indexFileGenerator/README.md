# index file generator

***
Our index file has two layers of index for sure and possibly one by-product table (still under discuss):

- Two layers:

    - outer layer (one file on disk):
            hash(word_i)    FilePointer
                0            filePtr0
                1            filePtr1
                2            filePtr2
        where FilePointer is ( file name, offset, numOfDupKey ), so each FilePointer is "pointing" to a page of the secondary layer:

    - secondary layer (multiple files on disk):

        - each file is essentially a "page", which consist the **binary** form of:           
                (hashvalue, docList, prevPage, nextPage)


***
Our index file generator will contain the following C++ classes:

- WordFPtrPair
 Â - it is in the form of:
        hash(word0) | FilePointer
- OuterLayer

- PageOfIndex

- SecondaryLayer
